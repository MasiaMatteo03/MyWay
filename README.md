### OUR IDEA
**We chose the theme  “Life on Earth”. Our idea is to measure the Earth's magnetic field, using the raspberry pi magnetic sensor, to predict  future changes (and the effects of solar wind) on animals' migration routes. We will also compare today’s animals’ migration routes with old ones to make more accurate predictions.**

### How will we use the Astro Pi computers to perform our experiment?

#### -Measurements and Algorithms
To develop our project we use principally the magnetic sensor.
The raspberry will do one measurement every 5 seconds. It will report and save each datum in its memory. In order to obtain more accurate data we will compare the ISS position during the algorithm execution with principal migration routes to know which magnetic field measurement is more important than others. 
Thereby we can avoid any mistakes in the data analysis.

Next, we will use other three sensors. 
The accelerometer and the gyroscope are useful to understand the ISS movement. 
The pi camera helps us to collect more data about migratory routes. The raspberry pi will apply on each photo the NDVI filter to detect vegetation on migratory routes. It does this to verify if migration routes are affected by the presence of urban area (for birds) or phytoplankton (for whales).
During the experiment, the Raspberry pi will compare the ISS position with some of the principal migratory routes, which we insert in the programme. In the following list, there are the animal species we will study.
-	The Black-bellied plover 
-	The Long-billed curlew
-	The Pacific loon
-	The Swainson’s hawk
-	The Blue whale
-	The Humpback whale

#### -Data Analysis
When we receive data, we will try predicting future changes in migration routes in the event of changes in the Earth's magnetic field. To do this we will compare old migrations routes with newer ones to increase the precision of our prevision. In the end, we will create a new world map within our results.

#### -Other considerations
According to the [National Geographic](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/2020/02/solar-storms-gray-whale-strandings-magnetic-sense/),  we want to try to prove that solar wind and the Earth’s magnetic field negatively affect whales migration and cause stranding.
We will also study some bird species to demonstrate the thesis of the [Australian Geographic](https://www.australiangeographic.com.au/topics/science-environment/2014/05/animal-magnetism-how-animals-use-earths-magnetic-field/) that even birds migrate following the magnetic field. However, differently from whales, they have their sensors on the beak.
